Freeview-EPG is a project designed to provide XMLTV data for UK free-to-air TV channels and radio stations for personal use.

## About
This project exists because of a gap in the market - up until recently, it was very hard to get hold of a free, reliably updated and region-supported XMLTV file. You could either get a TV tuner and grab the data, or pay for it from a service. I didn't like either of those options - looking at what's on TV should be easy and free, so now it is.
### Features
- 48 hours of data, built every 8 hours. If your TV/IPTV client supports auto-refresh, this is very much a set-and-forget solution.
- Supports regional channels, as well as just London-based ones.
- Includes data for both TV and radio stations.
- Data is reliably sourced from UK TV providers, rather than third parties. 
- Builds to an XMLTV file, complete with channel logos and programme images.

## Usage
Grab the XMLTV file from this link and paste it into your favorite IPTV client:
```

```

### To-do
- Improve code, maybe through splitting files and OOP
- Speed up EPG processing, probably using async code
- Finish adding regional stations
- Attempt to fix/find alternate EPG images

## Disclaimers
- You're welcome to request channel additions (see [Contributing](#contributing)), but I'll only add channels that are **free-to-air**.
- If you're looking for a longer EPG, the [custom](https://github.com/dp247/Freeview-EPG/tree/custom) branch allows for this. However, the logic of the branch is also out-of-date and I have no immediate plans to continue development on it.
- The software and data are provided as-is. While I intend for it to be as reliable as possible, certain aspects are out of my control.
